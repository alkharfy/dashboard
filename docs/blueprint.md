## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft blue (#90AFC5) for a calm, professional, trustworthy feel, inspired by classic CV designs.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F4F8), a subtle off-white that maintains focus on content in this light scheme.
- Accent color: Muted violet (#8DA9C4), for highlights and actionable items
- Body font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for body text, combining a modern look and a little warmth, paired with 'Playfair' (serif) for headlines for a modern high-end look
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' for displaying code snippets.
- Use simple, professional icons from a set like Remix Icon or Font Awesome to represent statuses, file types, and actions. Use filled icons for primary actions and outlined icons for secondary actions.
- Use subtle transition animations and loading spinners to enhance UX. For example, a fade-in effect when new tasks are loaded or a spinner while fetching data.
